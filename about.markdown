I'm currently a senior software engineer at Brigit, working on growing Instant Cash. Previously, I was a founding engineer at cmorq, and before that an engineer at Capital One. A common thread in my career and something I'm deeply interested in is consumer finance, why it still sucks for so many people, and how to improve it. Most of my writing and work here will probably center around that.

I live in Brooklyn with my fiancee, Abby. I'm passionate about food, both cooking it and eating it (find me on Beli @klein), I'm rekindling my childhood piano-playing capabilities, and I'm learning how to golf.
