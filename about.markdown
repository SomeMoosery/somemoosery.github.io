I'm currently a senior software engineer at Brigit, living in Brooklyn. Previously, I was a founding engineer at cmorq, and before that an engineer at Capital One.

I'll be updating this page with more information and writing in the coming weeks, more so as a dumping ground / repository of my thoughts than anything else.
